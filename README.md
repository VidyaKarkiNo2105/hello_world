# Hi, I would be honoured if you would join me. 
This is Srividya. As you can see by my user name KarkiNo - I am not exactly a big fan of cancer. 
I have created this site to immerse myself in the basics of python and then I hope to understand its use in bioinformatics. 
I hope, like you, to see some real progress on my side.
Thanks.
